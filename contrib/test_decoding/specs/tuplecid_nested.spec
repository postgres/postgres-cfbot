# Test decoding of a partially rolled back transaction where the aborted part
# is nested: the aborting outer subtransaction never produced any WAL of its
# own, so decoding cannot know its toplevel transaction, while an inner
# subtransaction it rolls back did produce WAL and its tuplecid records still
# have to be removed (BUG #19555 nested shape).
#
# The tuplecid records written by the aborted inner subtransaction are queued
# on the toplevel transaction and must be removed when the outer
# subtransaction's abort is decoded; otherwise they collide with the records
# of the line pointer that gets reused by the toplevel transaction's later
# catalog insert, failing Assert(ent->cmin == change->data.tuplecid.cmin) in
# ReorderBufferBuildTupleCidHash() when the commit is decoded.
#
#   - s0_topwrite makes the toplevel transaction produce its first WAL record
#     before any subtransaction exists.
#   - s0_outer establishes the outer savepoint, which never gets a WAL record
#     of its own.
#   - s0_catinsert1 generates an xl_heap_new_cid record in the inner
#     subtransaction, which is then released.
#   - s0_rollback_outer rolls the outer savepoint back.  Its abort record is
#     written once the backend is already in TRANS_ABORT, so it carries no
#     toplevel xid in its header and the outer subtransaction's association
#     with the toplevel can never be established.  The released inner
#     subtransaction is listed in the same abort record, though, and its
#     tuplecid records still must be removed from the toplevel's list.
#   - s2_vacuum reclaims the aborted row's line pointer (dead inserts are
#     removed regardless of the xid horizon, so this is deterministic even
#     while the toplevel transaction is still open); s0_catinsert2 then reuses
#     the same tid with a different cmin.
#   - s1_get_changes then decodes the toplevel commit and builds the tuplecid
#     hash; on unfixed builds the stale tuplecid of the aborted inner
#     subtransaction collides there with the fresh one.
