# Test decoding of a transaction in which a catalog-modifying subtransaction
# was rolled back, where the transaction spans a logical decoding restart
# point (BUG #19555 restart shape).
#
# The tuplecid records written by the aborted subtransaction are queued on the
# toplevel transaction and must be removed when the subtransaction's abort is
# decoded; otherwise they collide with the records of the line pointer that
# gets reused by the toplevel transaction's later catalog insert, failing
# Assert(ent->cmin == change->data.tuplecid.cmin) in
# ReorderBufferBuildTupleCidHash() when the commit is decoded.
#
#   - s0_insert runs in a subtransaction and produces its first WAL record.
#   - s0_catinsert1 generates an xl_heap_new_cid record in that subtransaction.
#   - s0_rollback aborts the subtransaction.
#   - s2_vacuum reclaims the aborted row's line pointer (dead inserts are
#     removed regardless of the xid horizon, so this is deterministic even
#     while the toplevel transaction is still open); s0_catinsert2 then reuses
#     the same tid with a different cmin.
#   - The transaction stays open across both checkpoints, so the final
#     s1_get_changes replays the transaction's records from the first
#     checkpoint and decodes its commit for output, building the tuplecid
#     hash.  On unfixed builds the stale tuplecid of the aborted
#     subtransaction collides there with the fresh one.
